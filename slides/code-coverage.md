### Code Coverage

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> What's not touched by tests?
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> No tests => higher risk
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Target coverage?

Note:

* As we introduce automated testing, we can also generate code coverage
    - Reports show which lines are never executed
    - Highlight high-risk areas of the application
* Often generated during CI
    - Coveralls, Code Climate, etc.
