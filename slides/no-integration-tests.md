    <p>Unit tests passing,<br>No integration tests</p>

Note:

* Unit tests passed: trash can can hold paper and waving your hand under the dryer turns it on
* Nobody thought "hey, does putting trash in the can trigger the hand dryer?"
* One of many such examples online, especially engineering Twitter
    - Unit tests passing, no integration tests
